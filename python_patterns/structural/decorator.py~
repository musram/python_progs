*What is this pattern about?
The Decorator pattern is used to dynamically add a new feature to an
object without changing its implementation. It differs from
inheritance because the new feature is added only to that particular
object, not to the entire subclass.
*What does this example do?
This example shows a way to add formatting options (boldface and
italic) to a text by appending the corresponding tags (<b> and
<i>). Also, we can see that decorators can be applied one after the other,
since the original text is passed to the bold wrapper, which in turn
is passed to the italic wrapper.
*Where is the pattern used practically?
The Grok framework uses decorators to add functionalities to methods,
like permissions or subscription to an event:

*TL;DR
Adds behaviour to object without affecting its class.
